# const heading = React.createElement
- This will create an object

# root.render(heading);
- When we do "root.render" it will basically take the object and convert it into HTML element and push it to the browser.
- Push it to the browser means it will REPLACE everything present in index.html with whatever we are rendering from here.

# JSX
- JSX is a javascript syntax which is easier to create react elements.
